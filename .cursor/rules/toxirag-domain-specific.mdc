# ToxiRAG Toxicology Domain Guidelines

## Toxicology Data Standards

### Units and Measurements
- **Tumor volume**: Always normalize to mm³ (accept mm³, cm³, mL with proper conversion)
- **Body weight**: Normalize to grams (g) from kg when needed  
- **Organ mass**: Normalize to milligrams (mg) from grams when needed
- **Drug dosage**: Store as mg/kg with frequency normalization
- **Timeline**: Use days since inoculation, convert weeks to days when explicit

### Data Quality Standards
- Use `未说明` for unknown/missing values instead of null, empty, or "unknown"
- Preserve original values alongside normalized ones
- Include calculation methods when volume is computed from dimensions
- Store units_version metadata for traceability

### Citation and Source Tracking
- Use format: `[E1 · 实验分组与给药]` for evidence citations
- Include original page numbers and table references
- Link citations to specific sections of source papers
- Maintain bidirectional mapping between citations and source content

## Toxicology Terminology

### Study Types
- Recognize: 移植瘤模型, 细胞毒性实验, 机制研究, 剂量效应研究
- Handle both Chinese and English terminology appropriately
- Standardize study type classifications across papers

### Biological Markers
- Properly handle cytokine names (IL-6, TNF-α, etc.)
- Recognize tumor markers and EMT indicators (E-cadherin, N-cadherin, Snail, Twist)
- Store statistical significance indicators (p-values, confidence intervals)

### Experimental Parameters
- Animal strains: Normalize common strains (C57BL/6, BALB/c, KM, SD)
- Sex classifications: {male, female, mixed, 未说明}
- Administration routes: Standardize abbreviations (iv, ip, po, etc.)
- Frequency codes: {qd, q2d, q3d, qod, qwk, bid, tid, 未说明}

## Data Validation Rules

- Validate dose ranges are reasonable for toxicology studies
- Check that timeline events are in logical order
- Ensure tumor volume values are within biological plausibility
- Verify statistical values (p-values between 0 and 1, etc.)
- Flag unusual measurement units for manual review

## Search and Retrieval Patterns

- Prioritize mechanism sections for mechanistic queries
- Weight data tables higher for quantitative questions  
- Consider both Chinese and English terms in search queries
- Use section type filtering for targeted retrieval
- Include experimental context in similarity calculations
