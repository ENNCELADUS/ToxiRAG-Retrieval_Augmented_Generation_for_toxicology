# 🎉 M2 Milestone Completed Successfully!

I have successfully implemented and tested the **M2 — Vector store and hybrid retriever** milestone with realistic data from 3 different papers. Here's what was accomplished:

### ✅ **Completed Tasks:**

1. **🔧 Hybrid Retriever Implementation** 
   - Created `retriever/retriever.py` with sophisticated hybrid search combining vector similarity and BM25 keyword matching
   - Implemented `ToxiRAGRetriever` class with customizable scoring weights

2. **🎯 Advanced Filtering & Scoring**
   - Section type filtering (mechanism, data_table, experiment_groups, tumor_model)
   - Document title filtering  
   - Similarity-based deduplication
   - Configurable vector vs BM25 weight balance

3. **📋 Evidence Pack Builder**
   - Proper bracketed citation format: `[E1 · 机制研究结果]`, `[E2 · 实验分组与给药]`
   - Metadata-rich evidence packs with source pages and citation details
   - Structured `EvidencePack` and `RetrievalResult` dataclasses

4. **🧪 Comprehensive Unit Tests**
   - **22 new tests** with realistic data from **3 different papers**:
     - **玉米花粉多糖的药理药效研究** (Corn pollen polysaccharide study)
     - **玛咖生物碱对人肝癌细胞Bel-7402和H22荷瘤小鼠的抑制作用** (Maca alkaloid study)  
     - **Effect of Modified Lichongtang Combined with 5-Fluorouracil on Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition in H22 Tumor-bearing Mice** (TCM + 5-FU study)
   - Tests for BM25 scoring, evidence packing, filtering, deduplication, and edge cases
   - **All 61 tests passing** 📊

5. **📦 Key Deliverables:**
   - `retriever/retriever.py` (469 lines) - Main hybrid retriever implementation
   - `tests/retriever/test_retrieve.py` (295 lines) - Core retrieval functionality tests
   - `tests/retriever/test_evidence_pack.py` (326 lines) - Evidence pack and citation tests
   - Updated `plan.md` with completed M2 checklist

6. **🔄 Git Workflow Compliance**
   - Committed to beta branch with detailed message
   - Pushed to origin/beta as required
   - Plan updated with completion status
